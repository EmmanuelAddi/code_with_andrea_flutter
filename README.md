# Code With Andrea - Flutter Clone

This project is a Flutter clone of the **home page** at [codewithandrea.com](https://codewithandrea.com/).

The project runs on mobile, desktop and web. A Flutter web build is hosted here:

- [Code with Andrea - Flutter web](https://code-with-andrea-flutter.web.app/#/)

It was built to analyze the performance of the same site built with **Flutter web** vs **HTML+CSS+JS** (see the performance comparison below).

## Supported Features

- Responsive navigation header on desktop, tablet, mobile
- Page intro
- Featured tutorials (cards)
- Flutter courses (cards)
- Testimonials section
- About section
- Email signup at the bottom
- Site footer

## Non-supported Features

This project is **not meant** to be a complete website, but **only a UI clone**.

As such, buttons and links don't do anything when clicked.

Furthermore, only the **dark theme** has been built (while the full site supports **light theme** also).

## Coding style

This prototype has been built in less than 10 hours. While the UI has been broken into small widget classes, this code is **not** production-ready.

## Performance report

TBC
